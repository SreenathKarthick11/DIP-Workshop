Introduction to Image Processing Techniques in OpenCV
Image processing is a powerful field in computer vision that involves techniques for analyzing and manipulating images. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) provides a comprehensive set of tools to perform these operations efficiently. In this workshop, we will explore the following foundational concepts:

Basic Codes: Introduction to OpenCV basics, including loading, displaying, and saving images, as well as basic manipulation techniques.

Noise and Illumination: Techniques to manage and preprocess images affected by noise or uneven lighting, which can degrade image quality and analysis.

Geometric Transformation: Manipulating images through scaling, rotation, translation, and other spatial transformations to align or reshape them.

Inverse of an Image: Understanding image inversion, where pixel intensities are reversed, often used for visualization or preprocessing tasks.

Image Thresholding: Segmenting images by converting grayscale images into binary images based on a threshold value to highlight regions of interest.

Contrast Stretching: Enhancing image contrast by redistributing the intensity values to make features more distinguishable.

Intensity Slicing: Extracting and emphasizing specific intensity ranges within an image, often used for feature detection or enhancement.

Log and Power Transformation: Applying non-linear transformations to enhance image details, particularly in images with uneven brightness or high dynamic range.

This workshop will provide hands-on experience with these techniques, enabling participants to understand and apply them effectively in real-world scenarios using OpenCV.
